Your friends helps you stay grounded.

Homie is the childhood friend that makes you feel safe and grounded. A bare bone alternative to Franz, a similar app that manages your favourite web services. It was created to provide a distraction free environment that's dead simple and extensible. Configure the app by updating the preferences and reloading, icons are automatically picked up by the domain and matched against a local bank of symbols.
